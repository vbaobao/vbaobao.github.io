# How to keep the site running

Set-up was done following [Github Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

## General Notes

* Periodically update `github-pages` gem with `bundle update github-pages`.

* Generate a local view of the site by running `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` in the terminal.
