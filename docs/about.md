# Hello! I'm Virginia and a software engineer

This website is a pseudo-portfolio and engineering blog.

I've always had an affinity for programming, but did not approach it as a career path until after I already graduated university.

But it's never too late, and there will always be technological advancements in one form or another. And I hope I will be there to be a part of it.
